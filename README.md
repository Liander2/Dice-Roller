# Dice Roller

A Diceroller App that has 8 different dices that each has a different range of values that they can give out, along with a - and + button to increase the total value of the dice result.
Each dice has a button shown as a picture for aesthetic purposes with a text to show the highest number the individual dice can roll. In this project i have made use of 2 different Functions, a Random number Generator, and a counter to add or remove from the Total Value of the dice roll.
